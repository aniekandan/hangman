# Hangman Game

**Hangman Game** is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. Players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters, with each incorrect guess resulting in the gradual drawing of a "hangman." The game provides an engaging challenge while reinforcing vocabulary and spelling skills.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
    ```

2. No additional libraries or packages are required, as the game is entirely built using Python's built-in modules.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script in a Python environment:

    ```
    $ python main.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to guess letters and reveal the hidden word.
3. The game displays the hangman's progress as incorrect guesses accumulate.
4. To play again, enter 'yes' when prompted.

## Example

```
$ python main.py
Welcome to Hangman!
Guess the letters to reveal the hidden word.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _

Enter a letter: e
E _ _ _ _ _ _

Enter a letter: a
E A _ _ A _ _

...

Enter a letter: t
E A S T E R _

Congratulations! You guessed the word: EASTER
Play again? (yes/no): yes
```
